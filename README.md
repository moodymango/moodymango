### About me 🥭 <br>
👩🏿 Hi, I'm Imma, a South Florida based software engineer passionate about the radical possibilities surrounding the intersection of social justice issues, tech and education. I leverage a background in the non-profit sector to create functional and performant full-stack applications tackling pressing social issues today.

  - 🔭 I’m currently working on Artsy Fartsy, an application empowering the everyday art enthusiast by encouraging users to make and share their own virtual exhibitions with artworks supplied by the Art Institute of Chicago's API.
    
  - 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and SQL

  - 😄 Pronouns: she/her

  - ⚡ Fun fact: I used to work at South Florida's largest LGBTQ+ Archive and Library.
